High Level Description:
breakout clone or similar game with collision detection -- I'd like an excuse to play with simple video game and visual toy concepts like colision detection, drawing 2d graphics programatically using canvas or similar, maintaining an interable state, etc as such using the arkanoid clone instructions at http://gamecodeschool.com/android/coding-a-breakout-game-for-android/ (or a similar educational source) I'll try to make a simple game that employs simple physics model. Customization of the experience could be had pehaps through shared prefs (or DB) traacking color, size or perhaps display bitmaps of some or all entities.

Individual Activities:

Breakout Clone
use physics, game state and graphics code as intended to play a  breakout clone

Difficulty config
change const values of speed of ball or number of hits to eliminate blocks 

Graphis swap 
some kind of interactivity to change how graphics end up being displayed to user (maybe choose a local image, then import it as a binary blob to a room databas for later loading 
into game mode) -- failure mode: colors could be chosen dynamically.

Navigation Drawer:
Main Menu: offer direction to activities
Dificulty config: to difficulty config

Header: show current difficulty and if in nightmode
